                                      <h6>May 10, 2024</h6>
                                      <p>As always, check out the design doc for my current project, <a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank"><strong>CS Profiles!</strong></a></p>
                                      <p>Really exciting week this week. Busted through a lot of interview problems, now I feel like an expert on Dynamic Programming. Found a site called WellFound which centers
                                      around Startup job postings, so I've started to shoot out applications for Full Stack positions on there. It feels like the perfect place to search since I really value ownership,
                                      independence, and a fast paced environment.</p>
                                      <p>Also, decided on a great introductory Django project : A redesign of this site with Django! I've been meaning to reformat this for a while, so with all the content already there,
                                      it'll be a great chance to extract some of it and create a new structure with Django. I've setup all the necessary Models and Views to support the Home page. It's been a lot of 
                                      fun figuring out Django, and I'm excited to showcase my progress with it next week! I've included some early mockups for the site below.<p>

                                      <h3>Mostly Interview Prep with a little bit of Learning</h3>
                                      <h6>May 3, 2024</h6>
                                      <p>As always, check out the design doc for my current project, <a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank"><strong>CS Profiles!</strong></a></p>
                                      <p>This week was mostly filled with all sorts of interview prep. I'm interviewing for full stack positions, so I'm covering quite a range of content in my preparation : anything and everything
                                      to do with data structures and algorithms. My favorites right now are Dynamic Programming problems, since they've given me trouble before. Alongside these fundamentals, I'm consistently brushing
                                      up on my SQL and Javascript interview questions as well.</p>
                                      <p>Alongside this preparation, I completed the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank">Django tutorial</a> this week, and have begun to experiment with it on my own. Planning to release a sample Django project by the end of next week.</p>
                                      <p>As always, good progress towards interview readiness, as well as my project. Stoked for what's next!</p>
                                      <h3>HTML / CSS Fun and Interview Prep</h3>
                                      <h6>April 26, 2024</h6>
                                      <h5>First Certification Project</h5>
                                      <p>This week I completed the first certification project for the Responsive Web Design course from FreeCodeCamp. A nice fun way to go back over some
                                      of the frontend building blocks! It's a simple exploration into HTML forms and basic CSS styling. Check out the <a href="https://dylanpjackson.github.io/SurveyForm/" target="_blank"><strong>site</strong></a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/DylanPJackson/SurveyForm" target="_blank"><strong>code</strong></a> if you're so inclined. Again, this is in support of development for <a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank"><strong>CS Profiles!</strong></a></p>
                                      <h5>Interview Prep</h5>
                                      <p>More interview prep also! There's a nice range of full stack roles and more backend focused, so I'm tailoring my interview prep to each of them.
                                      Centering on a mix of Javascript/React and Python at the moment.</p>

                                      <h6>April 19, 2024</h6>
                                      <p>Recently, fortunately, I have had some interviews so I've spent a bit less time on the project and more time on Leetcode and general interview prep. It's always fun refreshing on algorithms / data structures. I enjoy the time constrained problem solving where you need to not only logic your way to a solution, but code it out too.</p>
                                      <p>Besides that I've started to iteratively learn / refresh myself on the technologies I need for <strong><a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank">CS Profiles.</a></strong> Notably right now I'm working through the starter documentation for Django, and I feel excited to design a basic toy application with that soon. Also I worked through some HTML/CSS fundamentals and am excited to develop a small toy site with that as well. The general plan : learn enough to make the project; along the way, learn enough to make little projects to showcase my learning, then repeat! Overall, learning a lot, and enjoying it :)</p>

                                        <h3>CS Profiles : Design Decisions, Scope, Development Plan</h3>
                                        <h6>April 12, 2024</h6>
                                        <p>What is this project? Check out the <u><b><a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank">Design Doc!</a></b></u><p>
                                        <p>We are moving forward into development! I spent time researching UI Frameworks, Application Server / Web Frameworks, Hosting Services, Databases, Web Servers, and all their integrations to get a hold on what technologies I want and how they would all work together. With this information, I’ve scoped out a development plan with a Beta Phase, MVP, and additional features. Below is the architecture diagram for the beta phase, which includes all the major technical components. I’ve opted for a non-scalable approach at first just to get the logic of everything out of the way, then will add that in for the MVP. If you care to see more about the development plan and architecture decisions, visit the <u><b><a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank">Design Doc!</a></b></u></p>
                                        <img src="images/beta_architecture_diagram.png">
                                        <p>High priority is learning and developing, but something to get in the works early is a survey to gather Profile data from current engineers. This survey is dependent upon the database ‘schema’, so I’m working with django now to get a hold on how that interacts with the database. This will inform how I want to structure my database. Once I’ve got the structure sorted out, then I’ll be able to move forward with the survey, and further focus on development!</p>
                                        <p>I’m very excited to architect an entire application from end to end, and it certainly has been an incredible learning process so far. There is so much that goes into building a full stack application, and the research / decision making is part of what makes the process so exciting. Stay tuned for weekly updates!</p>

                                        <h6>April 3, 2024</h6>
                                        <h5>Intro</h5>
                                        <p>I've wanted to keep a blog for a while, and since I have a major project to track, I feel like now's the perfect time to start blogging!
                                        I'm actively growing and learning as a full stack engineer, so as I find topics that interest me, I'll share my thoughts here. 
                                        That's it! A place to <b>track projects</b> and <b>discuss interesting topics / ideas</b>.</p>
                                        <h5>CS Profiles</h5>
                                        <p>Speaking of projects, <b>I'm currently working on an exciting full stack project of my own creation!</b> As I've personally been searching for my next Software Engineering role, I've wondered, "What KIND of software engineer am I?" There are so many variations : Full Stack, Backend, Game Dev, Machine Learning Engineer, the list goes on. Each one has a different skillset required, and a different kind of person who would best succeed in them. I've been able to determine for myself that I prefer Full Stack roles, since I love the adventure involved in the system design process, I derive joy from creating an engaging user experience, and I find fulfillment from solving the interesting technical challenges that come from the backend. Though in order to figure that out, I had to ask myself, "Where do I derive fulfillment from in work?", "What do these different roles actually look like?", "What technologies do they use / what should I focus on now?", etc. I imagine since I asked myself these questions, people in similar situations must be grappling with them too! Why not make something that could remove all the ambiguity and uncertainty when choosing a CS career path? A solution that guides you towards the career where you'll find the most success and greatest sense of fulfillment? <b>Introducing : CS Profiles!</b></p>
                                        <p>CS Profiles is a Computer Science personality test to determine what career path you're most likely to find success and fulfillment from. After taking a short quiz and getting matched to one of many Profiles, users can learn about what best suits them, and what makes up various CS careers. The project is currently in the late design stage. Next update will be end of this week with a couple of the next few Design Phase Milestones completed. Once the Design Doc is complete, I'll post a formal update on LinkedIn to request help with gathering data for the project!</p>
                                        <p>You can find the Living Design, which contains the Philosophy, Architecture, Initial Logic, Design Tradeoffs, Timeline and more, here : <u><b><a href="https://quip.com/EIFeAhK3yqmp/Design-Doc-CS-Profiles" target="_blank">Design Doc : CS Profiles</a></b></u></p>
                                        <h5>Website Improvements</h5>
                                        <p>I'm planning to overhaul the appearance and technical design of this site, so expect some changes and blog posts pertaining to that! Namely, I want to reformat this Blog section so it's easier to filter posts and each post has its own minipage. I also want to separate out a lot of the statically stored info from the index file and place it in a database; a practice that I'm going to employ with CS Profiles. I've had this site since the start of college, so it's about time I upgraded!</p>
